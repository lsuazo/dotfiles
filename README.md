config files for personal setup

* Currently, I think regular bash (not zshell) together with tmux, and a good vim setup is a great combination.
* I am also very  much liking pyevn + virtualenv combination instead of conda

* for vim:
    - first install vundle (check git)
    - after downloading .vimrc don't forget pluginInstall

* bash:
    - remove bell (via inputrc)
    - vim keybindings: set -o vi

* pyenv?
